MICRO MORSE PHONE

Morse code was invented in 1836, way before texting! Morse only transmits one sound, so the alphabet is turned into combintations of short and long beeps. 

Similar to this, BBC micro:bits can't send voice messages, but they can send simple radio messages. This allows lots of micro:bits to talk to each other! Here we will send signals from one micro:bit (dot or dash) to any other micro:bits and make a handy translation code book that holds the BBC micro:bit with space to write down messages.
